    <li>equal parts carrot, red onion and celery</li>

    <li>salt</li>
    <li>nutmeg</li>
    <li>white pepper</li>

    <li>butter</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Ragu prep</h3>
    <p>combine the carrots, red onion and celery into a pot and salt them to begin sweating them down</p>
    <p>in a seperate pan on a high heat add some olive oil to the pan and coat the pan and put down the meat into the pan letting it get a myard reaction so it gets nice and cripsy before moving it to cook through fully</p>
    <p>once meat is cooked through add to the large pot with the vegetables and add tomato paste *please be sure to cook down the tomato paste so it is not raw</p>
    <p>after tomato paste is cooked down and incorporated into the meat and vegetable medley add some tomato sauce 3 ladles full and let it cook on a simmer for 4 hours</p>

    <h3>Bechamel prep</h3>
    <p>create roux with flour and butter</p>
    <p>bring to heat milk seasoned with salt, nutmeg and white pepper</p>
    <p>combine the flour and butter roux with the milk and whisk until thickened</p>
    <p>put aside in a seperate dish once desired thickness is attained and cover with a plastic film to not have a film develop on the top of the bechamel</p>

    <h3>Lasagna sheets prep</h3>
    <p> can make by hand or buy store bought sheets doesnt matter</p>
    <p>blanche sheets in boiling salted water for 30 seconds then dunk them into a cold pot of water to cook them so they are ready to be baked</p>
    <p>put olive oil between the sheets so they do not stick to one another</p>
   
    <h3>Lasagna Assembly</h3>
    <p>layer sheets > bechamel > ragu > parmesan cheese *use 36 month ages parmesan > repeat until desired height is reached / all resources exhausted</p>
    <p>at the higher levels of the lasanga you can thin down the bechamel with a little bit of milk to make it softer </p>

    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <p>put in oven at 200 degrees celsius for 30 minutes</p>
    <p>let it sit for 30 minutes before cutting</p>
